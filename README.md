# Robot-Factory-API
Build and train robots for effortless integration of advanced language models into your apps, ensuring precise, context-aware responses. Powered by Express and TypeScript.

## Data Model:

Create a data model for your robots and their memories. Each robot can have a list of question-answer pairs (memories) that they've learned over time.

## Training the Robots:

Implement a training mechanism to allow manual input of question-answer pairs for each robot. This is where you "teach" the robots.

## NLP Processing:

Utilize an NLP library or package (such as TensorFlow.js or the Hugging Face Transformers) to handle natural language processing. This will help the robot understand and analyze user questions.

## Matching User Questions:

When a user asks a question, the API will receive the question as input.
The API will then use NLP to find the most relevant question from the robot's memories that matches the user's query. This involves semantic similarity or intent matching.

## Generating Natural Responses:

Once the matching question is found, the robot should generate a natural response. This can be achieved by having predefined response templates associated with each question in the robot's memory.
You can use template-based responses and replace placeholders with relevant details from the matched question-answer pair.
